>@wiredfool, this is the expected behavior and I ran into it as well. Since apt-cacher-ng cannot cache the HTTPS connection so it's refusing to proxy it. A possible workaround is to let it pass through apt-cacher-ng using a regex like that in the config file:

>PassThroughPattern: ^apt\.dockerproject\.org:443$

>FYI. if you need to pass through more than one HTTPS destination, use that syntax as there can only be one PassThroughPattern directive:
